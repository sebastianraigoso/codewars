-- Write a function which reduces fractions to their simplest form! 
-- Fractions will be presented as an array/tuple (depending on the language) of strictly positive integers, 
-- and the reduced fraction must be returned as an array/tuple:

-- input:   [numerator, denominator]
-- output:  [reduced numerator, reduced denominator]
-- example: [45, 120] --> [3, 8]
-- All numerators and denominators will be positive integers.

-- # write your SQL statement here: 
-- you are given a table 'fraction' with columns 'numerator' (int) and 'denominator' (int)
-- return a query with columns 'numerator', 'denominator', 'reduced_numerator' (int) and 'reduced_denominator' (int)
-- sort results by column 'numerator' ascending, then by 'denominator' ascending
