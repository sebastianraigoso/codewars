-- Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, 
-- they will only know once they pick a flower each. 
-- If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and 
-- the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

-- Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower 
-- and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

-- # write your SQL statement here: you are given a table 'love' with columns 'flower1' and 'flower2', 
-- return a table with columns ('flower1' and 'flower2') and your result in a column named 'res'.

 
-- Solution 1
SELECT
  flower1,
  flower2,
  (flower1 % 2) <> (flower2 % 2) AS res
FROM love;

-- Solution 2
SELECT flower1, flower2 CASE
  WHEN (flower1+flower2) % 2 = 0 THEN false
  ELSE true
END
AS res
FROM love
