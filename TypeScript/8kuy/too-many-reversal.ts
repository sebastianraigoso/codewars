// You are an up and coming commentator in the brutal world of pro wrestling. 
// However, you suck at telling who reversed the reversal.

// You will be provided with a string in the format of : 
// "X hit a reversal to Y hit a reversal to X...... hit a reversal to (X/Y)"

// Rules:
// •The string starts and ends with the respective names of the wrestlers 
// (Not necessary that the starting and ending names be the same).

// •Input will always be validated.

// •X and Y will either be letters or single words.

// Determine and return the victor of the match.

// Be careful. 

// Your job is on the line!
