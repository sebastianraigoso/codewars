// Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

// Example
// ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'

// Assumptions
// You can assume that you are only given words.
// You cannot assume the size of the array.
// You can assume that you do get an array.
// What We're Testing
// We're testing basic loops and string manipulation. 
// This is for beginners who are just learning loops and string manipulation.

// Disclaimer
// This is for beginners so we want to test basic loops and string manipulation. Advanced users should easily be able to do this in one line.

// Solution 1
function smash (words) {
   return String(words).replaceAll(',', ' ')
};

// Solution 2
const smash = words => words.join(' ');

console.log(smash([])) // ""
console.log(smash(["hello"])) // "hello"
console.log(smash(["hello", "world"])) // "hello world"
console.log(smash(["hello", "amazing", "world"])) // "hello amazing world"
console.log(smash(["this", "is", "a", "really", "long", "sentence"])) // "this is a really long sentence"
